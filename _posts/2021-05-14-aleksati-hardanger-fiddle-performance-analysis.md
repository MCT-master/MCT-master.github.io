<!--# Problem space & Contribution
Analyzing musical performances is a challenging and emergent field of computational music research, aiming to reveal performance patterns and link them to musical contexts. The MIRAGE research project is contributing to this scientific body, currently addressing the modest amount of computational research on traditional Scandinavian folk music, utilizing a transdisciplinary approach that builds on contemporary musicological perspectives. However, collaborating across disciplines can introduce a number of challenges on its own. One way to mitigate challenges inherent in transdisciplinary research approaches is to develop tailored technologies that seek to increase the availability of expertise and knowledge across disciplines. Recent studies have also shown that most tailored technologies for music performance assessment are unreliable in educational settings, suggesting that further research is needed to evaluate the usability of research tools that explore musical performances. Inspired by these contemporary conundrums, and my ability to acquire detailed Hardanger fiddle performance data from MIRAGE, my research question became:

* **How can we design interactive computational tools to explore performance patterns in Hardanger fiddle music?**

The study aims to increase the availability of computational music research in the field of musicology and offers small contributions to the preservation and modernization of valuable cultural heritage.

# Approach
The thesis presents the development and evaluation of two software prototypes that integrate contemporary research perspectives on the complex rhythmical structuring of traditional Hardanger fiddle *springar* performances.


The proposed toolkit consist of three modules, implemented in [MaxMSP](https://cycling74.com/) using the [Bach library](https://www.bachproject.net/) with additional JavaScript code, all designed based on specific Hardanger fiddle performance data acquired from the [MIRAGE research project](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/projects/mirage/).


The goal was that this procedure would successfully

highlight important design concept and

for tools aiming to i


creating a better picture of how we can design .. tools that

important consideration to take when designing tools for the designated purpose..


The tools harbor a whole array of interactive and analytical features with several import and export options. However, each module has a primary functionality that is inspired by contemporary research on Hardanger fiddle performance patterns. The first module consists of an interactive score representation that enables users to manipulate the beat-level rhythmical structuring of the music. Modules 2 and 3 are considered more analytical in nature, featuring custom-built plotting interfaces. The second module enables users to explore how timing patterns are related to motivic structuring while module 3 harbors the ability to investigate if regions with similar rhythmical properties share other musical parameters, such as pitch, velocity and metric position. The learn more about the core functionalities of the tools, see the video demonstration below:

# Evaluation

The thesis evaluation featured both qualitative and quantitative methods, consisting of several operational tests and an online questionnaire.



Results show a demand for more tailored technologies in the field of musicology, particularly for tools capable of revealing the complex interrelations between musical dimensions through interactive and visual means. Additional findings highlight other design considerations for tools aiming to increase the availability of computational music research in the field of musicology, such as cross-compatibility and integrated features that actively facilitate nuanced interpretation processes.
