## About our team

The members of Team C all share the ambition of really getting out of our individual comfort zones as we work our way through the MCT programme! We came together with quite diverse academic and professional backgrounds, but quickly found that there is a lot of common ground between us at various levels. We look forward to collaborating, learning, sharing and hopefully creating a lot of great things together over the coming two years!

Have a look at our individual sections below to learn more about each of us.

Aysima is a Software Engineer with a bachelor degree in Mathematical Engineering. She graduated ten years ago and has been working on cloud systems as a full stack developer. In the last three years, her role has been developing services for an online meeting platform which focuses on hybrid and remote meeting solutions, therefore she is interested in learning how hybrid and remote setups can work for music performances. 
        
She has been playing accordion and learning different dances for several years. Music and performance arts has been something she tried to pursuit for long time but she thinks that she couldnt have the enough dicipline and focus in order to be productive at those two areas. 

She knows programming but she has no idea about sound, electronics and even music. She is seeing this programme as an oportunity to learn from others and produce solutions which brings programming, hybrid communication and music together.

Hello! I'm Fabian. I got Bachelor in Musicology from the University of Oslo specializing in music philosophy. My thesis explored the relationship between popular music and nostalgia, looking at different ways the past is used to todays music and how it affects our thoughts and feelings about the future. I have a passion for music production and (old) electronic music which naturally led me to the MCT program. What interests me in particular is getting a deeper understanding of the tools used in production and the interactivity between humans and computers.

### Olve Skjeggedal

For more than 20 years I have been working in the international maritime and offshore energy sector within engineering, business development, project management and corporate leadership, but have now reached a point in life where I want to follow my long-running dream of dedicating myself to music related activities full-time!

Despite my relatively long-running corporate career my greatest passion (apart from my children and wife) is music, which I have been doing in one form or another for most of my life. I learned basic skills and music theory in my childhood and early youth by taking lessons and playing the clarinet and classical guitar, and later I moved on to electrical guitar (and eventually also singing) which I have been doing since. I have played in several bands up through the years, and still do.

I am Norwegian and live just outside Oslo with my wife, our two teenagers and a labrador. Education-wise I have a MSc degree in Engineering from the NTNU technical university in Trondheim, and have also done 1-year full time programme in Music Production and Recording at the University of Stavanger. The integrated musical and technological nature of the MCT programme stands for me as the perfect way to combine my passion for music with my technological education and work experience, and I am really looking forward to it!
