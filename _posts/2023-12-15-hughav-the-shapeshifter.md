When we use motion capture or tracking (MoCap) systems to capture human body motion for artistic purposes, it can be easy to fall into ways of thinking that conceptually merge the physical body and the representation constructed from the captured or tracked data. A recent, high-profile example of this can be found in the rhetoric surrounding ABBA's comeback [Voyage](https://abbavoyage.com/) tour, which features avatars of the members of ABBA as they appeared in the 1970s created through the use of large scale motion capture, with the show's producer, Ludvig Andersson, employing strong terms to elide the bodies of ABBA and their <em>ABBA-tars</em>, stating that "when you see this show it is not a version of, or a copy of, or four people pretending to be ABBA, it is actually them" (ABBA Voyage, 2021).

However, many actors and technological systems contributed to the production of the <em>ABBA-tars</em>. A team of engineers and animators were involved in the process of constructing the body from the motion data. The technologies involved implied ways of working suggesting the forms that the body can take and what it can do. A number of younger stand-ins even provided the motion from which the virtual body was constructed (Plaete et al., 2022). Although choreographer Wayne McGregor noted that it was a "technical and emotional challenge" to get the members of ABBA "back into their bodies" (ABBA Voyage, 2021), the bodies visible in the show are, in effect, the result of a co-constructive process including all actors involved. In this context, eliding the physical body with representation can lead to the obscuring of assumptions about the body that all these actors bring.

This idea is the central to the research aim of this thesis:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>to critically explore the co-construction of a virtual representation of the body through the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture#Optical_systems"> optical, marker-based motion capture </a> in live performance, specifically focusing on dance.</b>
</div>
<br>
This aim is formalised in the following research questions:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>RQ1. How does the use of a motion capture system co-construct a virtual representation of the body in live performance, and which assumptions about the body does it make?</b>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>RQ2. How can a multi-modal interactive system be iteratively designed from a perspective which foregrounds motion capture as co-constructing a representation of the body?</b>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>RQ3. How does a performer experience their body in relation to the technological components in performance with a system for interactive dance?</b>
</div>
<br>
Accordingly, this thesis offers three main contributions:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>1. A theoretical framework which models the use of motion capture technologies to create a virtual representation of a physical body as a co-constructive process.</b>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b><em>2. The Shapeshifter</em>, a performance and multi-modal interactive system.</b>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>3. A qualitative analysis of the embodied experience of the project's collaborator of performing the work and their relationship to the technological components of the system from an embodied perspective.</b>
</div>
<br>

Although addressing each of the research questions required a diverse set of theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative methods, this thesis is encapsulated in a wider research-creation project. This is a methodological approach focused the combination of research methods and creative practices in a causal manner which leads to academic and artefactual results (Stévance and Lacasse, p. 123). This approach is well-suited for collaboration, and accordingly the work done for this thesis was carried out in collaboration with a performer who specialises in [physical theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_theatre) and dance.

# The Co-Construction Model

The main theoretical contribution of this thesis is a model of MoCap in live dance performance as a co-constructive process.

This model was developed to encourage a way of thinking about performance involving the use of motion capture that centres upon critical reflection on the assumptions and values that are embedded in the representation of the body created through the technology's use. The model depicts this occurring across five layers. These should not be understood as distinct and separated, but rather as nested within one another. They depict the increasing concretisation of the form of the virtual body, until this is realised in performance in relation to the physical body of the performer. Crucially, the flow of the embedding of assumptions and values is depicted as unidirectional, starting in the outer-most layer and flowing in towards the performance, but rather shows the propagation of assumptions throughout the entirety of the model. Through systematically assessing the locations of actors and technological systems, the assumptions and values that they bring, and how these manifest and interact in the representations that are co-constructed.

The co-construction model was developed upon a methodological foundation based upon the concepts of <em>normalcy</em>, a key concept relating to theorising the body in disability studies (Davis, 1995; Garland-Thomson, 1997), mediate auscultation, in which sensing devices conceptually stand in for that which is being sense (Sterne, 2001), and the propagation of aesthetic and ethical values through the appropriation of sensing devices for artistic practice (Naccarato and MacCallum, 2017).

A full description of the model, how it can be applied as a framework for system design or analysis, and its methodological basis can be found in chapter three of the thesis manuscript.
