When we use motion capture or tracking (MoCap) systems to capture human body motion for artistic purposes, it can be easy to fall into ways of thinking that conceptually merge the physical body and the representation constructed from the captured or tracked data. A recent, high-profile example of this can be found in the rhetoric surrounding ABBA's comeback [Voyage](https://abbavoyage.com/) tour, which features avatars of the members of ABBA as they appeared in the 1970s created through the use of large scale motion capture, with the show's producer, Ludvig Andersson, employing strong terms to elide the bodies of ABBA and their <em>ABBA-tars</em>, stating that "when you see this show it is not a version of, or a copy of, or four people pretending to be ABBA, it is actually them" (ABBA Voyage, 2021).

However, many actors and technological systems contributed to the production of the <em>ABBA-tars</em>. A team of engineers and animators were involved in the process of constructing the body from the motion data. The technologies involved implied ways of working suggesting the forms that the body can take and what it can do. A number of younger stand-ins even provided the motion from which the virtual body was constructed (Plaete et al., 2022). Although choreographer Wayne McGregor noted that it was a "technical and emotional challenge" to get the members of ABBA "back into their bodies" (ABBA Voyage, 2021), the bodies visible in the show are, in effect, the result of a co-constructive process including all actors involved. In this context, eliding the physical body with representation can lead to the obscuring of assumptions about the body that all these actors bring.

This idea is the central to the research aim of this thesis:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>to critically explore the co-construction of a virtual representation of the body through the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture#Optical_systems"> optical, marker-based motion capture </a> in live performance, specifically focusing on dance.</b>
</div>
<br>
This aim is formalised in the following research questions:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>RQ1. How does the use of a motion capture system co-construct a virtual representation of the body in live performance, and which assumptions about the body does it make?</b>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>RQ2. How can a multi-modal interactive system be iteratively designed from a perspective which foregrounds motion capture as co-constructing a representation of the body?</b>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>RQ3. How does a performer experience their body in relation to the technological components in performance with a system for interactive dance?</b>
</div>
<br>
Accordingly, this thesis offers three main contributions:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>1. A theoretical framework which models the use of motion capture technologies to create a virtual representation of a physical body as a co-constructive process.</b>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b><em>2. The Shapeshifter</em>, a performance and multi-modal interactive system.</b>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <b>3. A qualitative analysis of the embodied experience of the project's collaborator of performing the work and their relationship to the technological components of the system from an embodied perspective.</b>
</div>
<br>

Although addressing each of the research questions required a diverse set of theoretical, qualitative, and quantitative methods, this thesis is encapsulated in a wider research-creation project. This is a methodological approach focused the combination of research methods and creative practices in a causal manner which leads to academic and artefactual results (Stévance and Lacasse, p. 123). This approach is well-suited for collaboration, and accordingly the work done for this thesis was carried out in collaboration with a performer who specialises in [physical theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_theatre) and dance.
