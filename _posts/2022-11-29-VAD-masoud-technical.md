## Blackhole 
BlackHole is a modern MacOS virtual audio driver that allows applications to pass audio to other applications with zero additional latency. As a newly migrated user from Windows to Mac I found Blackhole, pretty reliable, easy to use, and easy to map between platforms, So I decided to share the features and make an installation and user guide! Enjoy!
