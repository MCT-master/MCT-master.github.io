# Composition

## Concept

We departed from the idea of making music for dreams. We all had to make individual contributons, i.e. separate parts of the composition. As we were four students in the group, we split the composition into ~ 1 minute long pieces, where three of them were different parts of a dream, and the fourth part was the part where our main character falls asleep and wakes up again. The division of labour went as follows:

1. Iggy was in charge of creating the introduction scene when the first person goes to sleep
2. Ulrik made the first dream scenario
3. Thibault made the second dream scenario
4. Simon made the third dream scenario

Iggy also made the outro to the composition where the main character wakes up from his dream.

The figure below shows an animation of the idea behind our composition.

### Thibault

This part was composed in a layer-by-layer fashion, improvising 6 voices on a violin (plus one bass note). All voices fit in an A Dorian scale, and stay on one chord (Am).

The idea was to experiment with layer-by-layer spatial automation recording. Indeed, the displacements have been recorder in the same order as the violin tracks, and the aim was to give it a comparable intention as the notes. Speed and proximity are used to reflect bow speed and pressure, but not in a proportional manner. Musical intention may be more intense with a softer sound, and in that case the track sounds very close to the listener.

For violin recording, a piezoelectric pickup was used. For ambisonic encoding, the IEM RoomEncoder was used. All was done in Reaper.

## Workflow

Some words about how we were in different cities and had to work together mostly over Zoom.

# Working at Notam

Iggy and Ulrik got the chance to work in Notam's spatial audio studio. That studio is equipped with 24 loudspeakers in a hemisphere, evenly distributed approximately 2.5 meters from the listener. It was a great experience, and made it easier to become fully immersed in the world of spatial audio.
