# Composition

## Concept

We departed from the idea of making music for dreams. We all had to make individual contributons, i.e. separate parts of the composition. As we were four students in the group, we split the composition into ~ 1 minute long pieces, where three of them were different parts of a dream, and the fourth part was the part where our main character falls asleep and wakes up again. The division of labour went as follows:

1. Iggy was in charge of creating the introduction scene when the first person goes to sleep
2. Ulrik made the first dream scenario
3. Thibault made the second dream scenario
4. Simon made the fourth dream scenario

Iggy also made the outro to the composition where the main character wakes up from his dream.

The figure below shows an animation of the idea behind our composition.

## Workflow

Some words about how we were in different cities and had to work together mostly over Zoom.

# Working at Notam

Iggy and Ulrik got the chance to work in Notam's spatial audio studio. That studio is equipped with 24 loudspeakers in a hemisphere, evenly distributed approximately 2.5 meters from the listener. It was a great experience, and made it easier to become fully immersed in the world of spatial audio.
