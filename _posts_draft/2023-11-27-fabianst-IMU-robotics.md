# Introduction
For our project we collaborated with [SiFi Labs](https://sifilabs.com/) to create and implement a system showcase how you can use their [BioPoint](https://sifilabs.com/biopoint/) biosensors to control a robotic arm. This was quite an ambitious and daring project. As this project was a collaboration between us MCT students and the informatics department we wanted to work on a project which could combine our different fields of expertise. The task we set out to do was to get the robot painting. We thought replicating the precise movements needed to paint is something was a fitting task for this project.
# Implementation 

## The BioPoint
The [BioPoint](https://sifilabs.com/biopoint/) is a powerful and lightweight device developed by SiFi labs featuring 6 different sensors capable of recording almost any biosignal imaginable. For our usecase we were mostly interested in utilizing the [Intertial Measurement Unit sensors (IMU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit) on the device. Multiple of our team members have previous experience using these sensors for [artistic applications](https://mct-master.github.io/motion-capture/) so we thought it would be fitting for our project. 

## Introducing the Robot
Meet the robot we worked on for this project. The [Universal Robots UR10e](https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur10-robot/). This is a medium sized industrial robot, and is also quite large as you can see!
