# Jamulus, or jamu-less?

Playing music together is not at all only about hearing, but also about the visual. Today the MCT students of 2020 experienced this in a “low latency jam session” in Jamulus. Short version of what Jamulus is: an online play-together program, that lets you join sessions with other musicians. You need to install Jamulus to your computer, and ideally use a cabled connection to the internet.

You can either join an existing server, or set up your own server if you like a more private jam-session. We all connected to a closed server located at NTNU in Trondheim, and total delay (latency) for those of us who are located in Norway was between 20 and 45 ms, which is decent, but also enough to make rhythmic and percussive music a little hard to play.

## B-jam
In the B-team three of us are in Norway, and one in Ecuador, meaning that we needed to figure out what kind of music we thought would work. We decided to go for an easy chord progression, based on some droning tones in a patch from a Moog Voyager. The rest of the setup was an electric guitar, electric guitar tuned like a lute (a lute-caster!), and an old pump-organ. We used a drum-loop to hold it all together, and it kind of worked. Our music was very textural, and consisted more of soundscapes than melodies.
The reason it kind of worked for us was primarily because the chords we used worked well with the same basic set of notes. It would be interesting to try it again with something more structural. Something with notes starting and ending at specific times. Maybe the outcome would be different then. It’s easier to get something to sound good when it doesn’t matter what chords and notes are being played where.

## Sound
The quality of the sound is not recordable, and there were some clicks and pops, but it is possible to play together with ok quality, if you have ok bandwidth and you are not too far away from each other (and the server) geographically.
We were experiencing a phonographic effect caused by sound quality. Reducing the quality makes it less “meaningful” to play together, as some of the fun is to hear the details in what your co-musicians are playing.
The real challenge was to place yourself and your co-musicians in the mix. To keep the latency low, most people will use mono sound, and then the mixer doesn’t have options for panning when playing mono, making it feel a little like a wall of sound.

## Audiovisual
The experience also made clear that playing together is not only about hearing – but also about seeing – each other. When jamming with other people, especially people you haven’t played with before and don’t know musically, seeing is essential. It might be another experience if we had tried a standard song everyone knew really well, but without being able to communicate visually while playing (we tried to use Zoom for this simultaneously and found it more confusing than no visuals at all), Jamulus and other services like it will remain good ideas that haven’t yet been successfully executed.
