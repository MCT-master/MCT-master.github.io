# Introduction

For our third network musical performance as MCT students, we teamed up with students from Edvard Munch High School in Oslo to put together a jazz concert between Salen at the Department of Musicology and the motion capture lab at RITMO. Read below for a look behind the scenes and some reflections on the event from the RITMO performers and technicians.

First though, some fun facts and figures. Salen and RITMO are roughly 870 metres apart. Sound travels at approximately 343m/s so it would take sound around 2.5 seconds to travel that distance. However, using the LOLA network we are able to send sound and video from one location to the other and back again in 17 milliseconds. In other words, we played jazz at 149 times the speed of sound, or 184,000km/h.

The ensemble from Edvard Munch High School consists of 3 singers, 2 trumpets, piano, electric guitar, bass guitar, and drum kit. We split the ensemble between our two locations, with the trumpets and guitars performing at RITMO.

# Student Reflections

After the performance, we spoke to the RITMO performers to understand their experience of playing telematic music. This was their first experience of network musical performance for all the musicians, therefore we were excited to learn more about their perspectives on the technology. The performers all found the experience to be rewarding. However, they also identified several issues which largely fall into two categories: those inherent to telematic performance, and flaws with our specific setup.

All the RITMO performers found that they missed the physical aspect of performing together in the same room. Specifically, they found it difficult to properly feel the groove as this relies as much on feeling physical movements together as it does listening to bandmates. This could be rectified partly through changes to the setup in each location. The Salen camera was placed facing towards the performers which the RITMO performers said made them feel like they were playing to, rather than with, their counterparts. Placing the Salen camera amongst or behind the performers could have therefore helped to alleviate this issue. Relatedly, the RITMO performers were seeing the Salen musicians on a fairly large TV. A larger view, such as the large projector screens included in the NMP kit, could have helped to make the RITMO performers feel like they were part of the action.

The RITMO performers also identified that performing using headphones felt unnatural and took away from the live feeling of the performance, instead feeling more like a studio or practice session. We chose to use headphones for two main reasons: to minimise bleed into the trumpet and guitar microphones, and because the speakers at our disposal were not large enough for monitoring over loud brass instruments. It is therefore possible that we could have relied on monitoring through wedge speakers, but this might have caused issues with bleed and feedback.

# Conclusion

According to some reflections, the capability of NMP performance is still unknown, even among younger generations. Furthermore, many conceptions are the result of cultivated expectations. For example, our young performers generally agreed that rhythmic music with repetitive patterns is easier to perform telematically. However, we are aware that this is not always the case. This may indicate that some kind of familiarization and education is required. Perhaps physical and virtual communication courses will be offered in schools in the near future!
