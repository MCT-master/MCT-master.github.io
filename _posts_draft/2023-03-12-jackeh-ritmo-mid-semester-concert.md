# Introduction

For our third network musical performance as MCT students, we teamed up with students from Edvard Munch High School in Oslo to put together a jazz concert between Salen at the Department of Musicology and the motion capture lab at RITMO. Read below for a look behind the scenes and some reflections on the event from the RITMO performers and technicians.

First though, some fun facts and figures. Salen and RITMO are roughly 870 metres apart. Sound travels at approximately 343m/s so it would take sound around 2.5 seconds to travel that distance. However, using the LOLA network we are able to send sound and video from one location to the other and back again in 17 milliseconds. In other words, we played jazz at 149 times the speed of sound, or 184,000km/h.

The ensemble from Edvard Munch High School consists of 3 singers, 2 trumpets, piano, electric guitar, bass guitar, and drum kit. We split the ensemble between our two locations, with the trumpets and guitars performing from RITMO.
