## Arvid Falch
Arvid Falch is a norwegian music composer. Born in 1980, he started playing the violin at age six and went on to become a guitarist, songwriter, artist and media composer.
He spent his twenties playing with indierock bands I See Horses and Fender Heist, and toured as a guitar player with a variety of artists. In 2008 he started pursuing a career as a media composer, and has since then composed music for a variety of films, TV series, apps, shorts and more. He was also a part of the now extinct duo Indianarane who made music for many hundred norwegian TV commercials. 

Musically Falch has steered more towards the classical world in the later years, but he still hangs out with his old band mates jamming with synths and guitars whenever he's able.

Falch is a father of two children and resides just outside Oslo, Norway. When not making music he can be found flyfishing in the local rivers or playing tabletop roleplaying games with his friends.
