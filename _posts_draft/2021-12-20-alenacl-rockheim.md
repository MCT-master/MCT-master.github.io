# Rockheim museum
## About an interactive exhibition

Rockheim is one of Norway’s most exceptional museums. It is _the_ National Museum for Popular Music from the 1950s to the present. It is housed in a former warehouse on the bay of Trondheim.
The primary mission of the museum is to preserve and document Norwegian popular music through diverse exhibitions.



One of their main permanent exhibition is known as 'The Time Tunnel' and it opened to the public on 5th August 2010.
Rockheim’s biggest attraction presents music and artists in a cultural-historical context. The time travel starts in the 1950s, when rock first came to Norway, and continues towards the present time. Using interactive dissemination technology, the public is invited to actively participate during their visit. As part of the museum's staff the guides who are present on each floor of the museum help create a smooth experience, by assisting the audience and engaging them in conversation.

Centering into one part of the exhibit is a massive screen which is located at the entrance to the floor, divided in to six segments, one for each decade, is an interactive gesture-based wall. Coming into play the MCT students investigate and provide improvements to this huge wall. 

### Problem description + details about the existing screen

This main screen has 6 divisions one for each decade, each displaying the images of artists as a slide show format.  
In front of the screen stickers are placed on the floor and above the stickers closer to the ceiling are the webcam sensors are placed, when a person stands on the stickers, the camera detects the hands or the body of person. The outline of the movement is displayed on the screen, the images on the screen are covered with a hazy layer. The movement of the hands determines the clearing of the hazy layer


>>> add here that for this project the external partner wanted to focus more on the practical feedback rather than literature search nd theory; they wanted to know what the visitors of their museum thought about the screen and wanted to improve.


### Our proposed solution
Our solutions consisted of:

Hardware: Using camera technology such as the Microsoft’s Azure Kinect when placed in front of the user would enhance the results of detection and user’s feedback perception. The Azure has a body recognition system which can be utilized to extract minute gestures and when mapped intuitively can have versatile applications.

Software: The default application on the system was a basic slide show of images/artist, where the timing cannot be controlled, nor the selection of the image/artist. Our team proposed a system where the person can select the decade by pointing with his hand and using gestures to rotate and zoom in and out of the artist, he/she would prefer to listen to.

Gesture elicitation: Based on our initial research, we found that a general study of how the visitors explored and interacted with the screen was not done. This led us to propose to perform an elicitation in Rockheim physically.


### Implementation phase: gesture elicitation at the museum, hardware and software setup and design

### Demo and thresholds

### Our team and the workflow + challenges

### Imprevements and future recommendations
