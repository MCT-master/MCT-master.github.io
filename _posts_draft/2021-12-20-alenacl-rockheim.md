# Rockheim museum
## About an interactive exhibition

### Introduction

Rockheim is one of Norway’s most exceptional museums. It is _the_ National Museum for Popular Music from the 1950s to the present. It is housed in a former warehouse on the bay of Trondheim.
The primary mission of the museum is to preserve and document Norwegian popular music through diverse exhibitions.

One of their main permanent exhibition is known as 'The Time Tunnel' and it opened to the public on 5th August 2010.
Rockheim’s biggest attraction presents music and artists in a cultural-historical context. The time travel starts in the 1950s, when rock first came to Norway, and continues towards the present time. Using interactive dissemination technology, the public is invited to actively participate during their visit. As part of the museum's staff the guides who are present on each floor of the museum help create a smooth experience, by assisting the audience and engaging them in conversation.

The massive grid of walls is located at the entrance of the floor, in front of the elevators. It consists of six displays with each orientated as portrait. From left to right they are assigned for the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and 00s, respectively. Static images depicting artists of each decade are shown until someone interupt the flow by "breaking the glass". In front of the screens stickers with each decade are placed on the floor to mark where on the ceiling are the webcam sensors placed. When someone stands on a sticker, the camera detects the shape of hands or the body of person from above. The outline of the movement is overlayed on the screen with green, over the virtual glass layer over the static images. By moving the hands, the person can "break the glass over the screen", resulting in a short video of that artist playing.

### Our applied project

Since this main interactive exhibition was implemented in the museum, technology evolved considerably, and several problems became clear:
    - it was not obvious that the exhibition was interactive;
    - only one person at a time could use the entire exhibition;
    - the division by decades meant that all the music created from the 2000s until now was piled unde only one screen;






>>> add here that for this project the external partner wanted to focus more on the practical feedback rather than literature search nd theory; they wanted to know what the visitors of their museum thought about the screen and wanted to improve.


### Our proposed solution
Our solutions consisted of:

Hardware: Using camera technology such as the Microsoft’s Azure Kinect when placed in front of the user would enhance the results of detection and user’s feedback perception. The Azure has a body recognition system which can be utilized to extract minute gestures and when mapped intuitively can have versatile applications.

Software: The default application on the system was a basic slide show of images/artist, where the timing cannot be controlled, nor the selection of the image/artist. Our team proposed a system where the person can select the decade by pointing with his hand and using gestures to rotate and zoom in and out of the artist, he/she would prefer to listen to.

Gesture elicitation: Based on our initial research, we found that a general study of how the visitors explored and interacted with the screen was not done. This led us to propose to perform an elicitation in Rockheim physically.
