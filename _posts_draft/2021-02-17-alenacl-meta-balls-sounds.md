excerpt: "Just a new phone or could it actually contribute to our online lives? This is not part of any course or anything, but I wanted to put down my thoughts on this new app. After all, it's all about audio and streaming which is very MCT, so I hope it's OK."

In the two-week workshop, we will focus the effort on one larger group project. In this project you will develop an application of audio programming, using Csound for the audio processing and one of the suggested interfaces (PythonAPI, Web, OSC, VST). Preparatory materials are available under Resources.

Examination

The result of the workshop is an audio aplication of your own design, made as a group work. It must be presented during the session on 19. February, and also documented in a blog post on the MCT blog.

Summary of expectations and/or requirements to complete the course, etc.

    Minimum attendance requirements: attendance to the lectures listed above and the final presentation, as well as significant participation in the group effort of making the project.
    The final project will be graded based on these aspects:
        To what degree you have explored new audio programming techniques (new to you!)
        A well defined purpose for the audio application (what does it do and why is that a good thing?)
        How well it fulfills the stated purpose
        Interfacing and accessibility for the intended user
        Quality of code:
            clarity in structure, sensible variable names
            appropriate documentation for
                yourself to be able to pick it up later
                others to re-use and build upon
        Clarity of presentation
            in class and in blog post
        Description of your own role in the group effort.
