## Put some latency in the tempo

As part of our assignment in Pysical-Virtual Communication and Music we have been designing networked music performances and also reading about other group's challenges and learnings. For one of our assignment, we investigated the various strategies to work with latency in Network Music Performances from [Fundamentals and Principles of Music Telepresence Paper](https://revistas.ucp.pt/index.php/jsta/article/view/6956) by by Alexander Car√¥t and Christian Werner. In this blog we will try to tell you some insights about Master-Slave Approach and Laid Back Approach.
