For this project, I wanted to create an interactive music system based on my own voice. Being inspired like Holly Herndon's SPAWN, I tried to investigate ways of making one monophonic voice sound like a full choir. Spoiler alert: it ended up sounding more like a detuned alien than a choir.

## Design

## Reflection

Due to various circumstances, I didn't get to work as much with this project as I would like to. One of the things I realised too late that I should have set aside more time to design the physical system. Almost until the deadline, I worked only with the software, and with the sensors loosely coupled together on the breadboard. For the next physical interface I'm making, I think I will try to start in the other end - by first sketching out how I want the system to look and feel, and design the audio engine based on the affordances of that physical interface.
