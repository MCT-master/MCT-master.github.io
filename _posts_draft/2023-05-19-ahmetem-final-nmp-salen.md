For our final network music performance...

# Preparation

We started planning # weeks in advance to get ready for this big event. ...

In our first planning session we tried to draw an outline for our part in the concert, and our composition. We roughly decided on the performers and the instruments. We also discussed the concept of out composition, and room for other musicians. However going forward we decided to not to create a composition and only perform in the concert with other people.

## Performers and Instruments

We performed with variety of instruments and techniques covering a wide spectral range in addition to the balance between tone and noise.

| Performer        | Instrument          |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Fabian           | No-Input Mixing     |
| Aysima           | Accordion           |
| Emin             | Ney Flute           |
| Alex             | Electronics         |
| Nino             | Vocal with effects  |
| Kristian         | Experimental Guitar |
| Kristin Nordeval | Clean Vocals        |

Fabian's __No-input mixer__ ...

Aysima's __Accordion__ ...

__Ney__ is a _fretless_ wooden flute capable of creating both noisy and tonal sound, which enables an experimental space for its performer. With his Ney, Emin played melodic lines and noise effects during the concert.

# Getting Technical

In this concert, we transmitted audio using a network music performance software, [JackTrip](). We connected to the network with one of the [MCT's portable LoLa kits]().

## Video Connection

During the concert, all the participants met in a Zoom call to follow Douglas' conducting and interact with other musicians. We used the Logitech PTZ meeting camera in the Salen to share the video of the entire stage.

To follow the conductor and the live score, we placed two monitors on the stage in front of us, one for Douglas' video, one for the live score page. These two screens were connected to a laptop. We also projected both on the projection screen on the stage for the audience, which is connected to the stationary computer in the Salen.
