For our final network music performance **Dispersionology and Other Tales** we have performed with many musicians in several countries in a performance conducted by Douglas Van Nort.

# Concept

For this telematic experience, as MCT Students, we contributed an improvisational performance conducted in US and performed in more than four countries.?? 

Douglas Van Nort describes the performance as: 
>"In the world of physics, dispersion describes a phenomenon in which the rate of propagation of a wave in a medium, its phase velocity, is dependent on its frequency. This can be seen in light, sound, gravity waves, etc. Its a property of telecommunications signals, including the pulses of light in optical fibre cables, describing how the signal broadens and spreads out as it moves across the channel. Dispersion therefore is inherent in the medium that more-and-more binds us these days, in the movements of light pulses that transports our attention, and our listening, around the globe. A beautiful consequence of dispersion is a change in the angle of refraction of different frequencies, leading to a prismatic opening up of a full colour spectrum from incoming light. This ability to broaden out as signals propagate through the network reflects a much wider expansion of distributed listening and sounding that is made possible in the context of telematic musicking. It occurred to me recently that, as of early 2023 Iâ€™ve engaged this medium now for 20 years, with an ear towards exploring the myriad ways that the shared real/virtual and nowhere/everywhere site of performance can act as both a point of convergence towards a singular locus of performative attention -- yet also a dispersive prism, reflecting individual voices and the preservation of creative agencies of every performer."

## Pieces

...

# Preparation

We started planning # weeks in advance to get ready for this big event. ...

In our first planning session we tried to draw an outline for our part in the concert, and our composition. We roughly decided on the performers and the instruments. We also discussed the concept of out composition, and room for other musicians. However going forward we decided to not to create a composition and only perform in the concert with other people.

## Performers and Instruments

We performed with variety of instruments and techniques covering a wide spectral range in addition to the balance between tone and noise.

| Performer        | Instrument          |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Fabian           | No-Input Mixing     |
| Aysima           | Accordion           |
| Emin             | Ney Flute           |
| Alex             | Electronics         |
| Nino             | Vocal with effects  |
| Kristian         | Experimental Guitar |
| Kristin Nordeval | Clean Vocals        |

Fabian's __No-input mixer__ ...

__Accordion__ can play both melody and bass section in a composition. For the parts lead by Douglas, accordion had different roles. While playing a musical composition like phone ringing, accordion contributed with the keyboard part and played notes in sequence. For some other parts it was better for accordion to bring sustain sounds with high or low pitches depending on the character of the composition.

__Ney__ is a _fretless_ wooden flute capable of creating both noisy and tonal sound, which enables an experimental space for its performer. With his Ney, Emin played melodic lines and noise effects during the concert.

# Getting Technical

In this concert, we transmitted audio using a network music performance software, [JackTrip](). We connected to the network with one of the [MCT's portable LoLa kits]().

## Audio Engineering

## Video Connection

During the concert, all the participants met in a Zoom call to follow Douglas' conducting and interact with other musicians. We used the Logitech PTZ meeting camera in the Salen to share the video of the entire stage.

To follow the conductor and the live score, we placed two monitors on the stage in front of us, one for Douglas' video, one for the live score page. These two screens were connected to a laptop. We also projected both on the projection screen on the stage for the audience, which is connected to the stationary computer in the Salen.
