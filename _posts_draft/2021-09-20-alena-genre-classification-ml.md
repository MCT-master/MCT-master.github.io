After a long sunny summer, we started our autumn semester with a very compact and interesting course - __Machine Learning (ML)__! The course was no joke, it's great that we are done with a course by the 20th of September, but these past weeks were interse after the lethargy of the hot season. We've learnt a lot during this time, thought, and parts of that is the fact that ML is not the answer to anything. It's a very good technique for _some_ questions but not _all_.
