When it comes to play over the Network, the main problem is to try to keep a common rhythm going between remote musicians. Maintaining a shared beat or sense of pulse is difficult if it takes too long for one musician's sound to reach another's ears. There can be drastic consequences. Well, here at [MCT](https://www.uio.no/english/studies/programmes/mct-master/) we try to different solutions to avoid this the best we can. This time we set up a Network Musical Performance (NMP) over 5G Network at the headquarter of [Telenor](https://www.telenor.no/privat/).
