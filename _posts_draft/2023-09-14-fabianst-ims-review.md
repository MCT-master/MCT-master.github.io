excerpt: "A deeper dive into the Magpick"

There are many ways of playing and expressing yourself using the guitar. Either through the use of [extended techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJZvc24IaD4&list=PLk9q3gCxIzjcmDlTBtBw-wMcErt6KqdYc&index=4), [effect pedals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYaloTRzVtc), or even [augmented guitars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXhh9hSlyHs). If you want to control and manipulate the signal coming from the guitar you're generally forced to  use your feet to control pedals. But this introduces some problems in regards to adjusting pedal parameters while playing...........

The Magpick introduced at NIME 2019 is an augmented guitar plectrum which enables the user to control pre-defined effects using magnetic signals emitted from the guitar's pickups. This pick promises low latency and highly nuanced control over the sound by using the [bela platform](https://bela.io/).
