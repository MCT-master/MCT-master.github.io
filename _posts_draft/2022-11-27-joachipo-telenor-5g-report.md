## Introduction 
The objective we had when carrying out this Network Music Performance (NMP) was to test the latency of Telenor’s 5G network so as to find out whether currently musicians could use 5G to execute this type of performance. In order to do that, we first needed to optimize the latency with the factors under our control: finding the best configuration that would lower or just not add latency. We tested different networks, settings and distances to prepare. Finally, we travelled to Telenor Fornebu and, more specifically, to their magnificent villa, did the final tests and experimented with our music performance.

## Telenor 5G Experimental 
As a concluding part of our test phase, we spent the two days at the Telenor Testbed doing measurements on the experimental 5G network as well as preparing for the final NMP. We were eager to test the possibilities (and limits) of a closed-off version of the 5G network, in which you have all the network bandwidth you could ever wish for available for yourself. Sadly, the experimental network was not yet stable enough for a NMP, as the connection lasted about 40 seconds before disappearing for 20 seconds. We hope to be invited back when it’s up and running!
