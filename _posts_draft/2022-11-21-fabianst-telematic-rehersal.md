# Rehearsing Over the Net with LoLa
As a part of the MCT4024 course we were asked to set up and organize a telematic concert. This means playing together in separate spaces over the internet. For this we used a software called [LoLa](https://lola.conts.it/) running on specialized computer racks. LoLa is made for low-latency real time transfer of both audio and video which makes it an ideal software for telematic performances.

## Our Concert
Our concert was a part of the [Embodied Perspectives on Musical AI](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/news-and-events/events/workshops/2022/embodied-ai/index.html) workshop held at UiO where we were asked to put on a 20-minute performance. The performance was held between the UiO Science Library and the RITMO research center and consisted of two parts. First part consisted of two cover songs while the second part was a semi-improvised electroacoustic piece. You can watch the performance [here](https://youtu.be/pIq6TP2ox5c?t=423)

## The Virtual Room
One thing I quickly noticed while rehearsing using LoLa was how disconnected you initially feel from the other performers. This feeling can be avoided by moving the cameras closer to the performers. This also helps with visual cues which can be a lot harder to pick up on unless they've been explained beforehand. All movements have to be exaggerated, at least during the beginning of rehearsals.
