# Rehearsing Over the Net with LoLa
As a part of the MCT4024 course we were asked to set up and organize a telematic concert. This means playing together in separate spaces over the internet. For this we used a software called [LoLa](https://lola.conts.it/) running on specialized computer racks. LoLa is made for low-latency real time transfer of both audio and video which makes it ideal for telematic performances.

## Our Concert
Our concert was a part of the [Embodied Perspectives on Musical AI](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/news-and-events/events/workshops/2022/embodied-ai/index.html) workshop held at UiO where we were asked to put on a 20-minute performance. The performance was held between the UiO Science Library and RITMO research center.
