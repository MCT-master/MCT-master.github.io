# B-team reflection

The B team is a particularly diverse group of individuals. Even by the standards of the MCT program, we have unusually eclectic skill sets. Often this variety is a strength, but for this assignment that may not have really been the case. Read on for four **very** different perspectives on a brief adventure in problem solving.

A bit of background. The task: creating a new csv file containing data from an original csv file and defining specific attributes of 60 individual wav files. Some of the knowledge needed for the task is easy if you have programming experience. It's a matter of knowing what functions to use, and which functions exist.

The task wasn't too clear on that we shouldn't be aware what's in the csv-file. We couldn't see the file, so we went for retrieving the header data rather than printing it to tell us what the headers are, requiring a level of human interpretation.

#### Henrik's reflection
At first I thought the assignment was pretty overwhelming and I didn't think I was ever going to be able to finish it. But after some lines of code I began to understand how this program should work, and then it was quite easy and fun from there. I got a little tangled up in the thought of modifying the existing csv-file rather than reading the old one and making a new one, which was a way easier approach. We had a quick chat after Friday's class and Pedro showed how we write csv-files. Had a lot of fun thinking about solutions for this program and then testing them. Especially for plotting the data. Overall my thoughts are that this was a good task and that it's a nice way to learn how to apply the concepts from class. I find working with tasks like this is motivating.

#### Willie's reflection (aka in which I gently imploded)
As a complete newcomer to python and almost complete newcomer to the greater world of coding, this assignment felt a bit like my Everest. Before this, I’d successfully completed small tasks, but this was of a different scale. It did not go well.

My initial attempts to create useful code made it as far as seeing the csv file data before the train began to derail. Accessing the wav files was a significant roadblock for me, as was then calculating values via the data contained within them. Unfortunately, even though I had a vague sense of how to create the scatterplots that the assignment called for, that knowledge was useless without the data to fill the plots. Having spent far more time than was wise trying to complete this task, I turned to my fellow B-teamers for assistance and was very interested to see how different each person’s code was. I see that there are many ‘right’ ways to complete tasks like this. However, I can personally attest after much experience that there are also many, many wrong ways.

Looking to the future! I have a lot to learn. The more masterful coders of Team B have identified some resources for me to utilize as I try to catch up. I hope to someday be coding in style and laugh at tasks like this, but, until that day comes, I will remain the most easily confused coder in the room.
