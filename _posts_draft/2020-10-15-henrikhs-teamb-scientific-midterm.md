# B-team reflection
Some of the knowledge needed for the task is easy if you have programming experience. It's a matter of knowing what functions to use, and which functions exist.

The task wasn't too clear on that we shouldn't be aware what's in the csv-file. We couldn't see the file, so we went for retrieving the header data rather than printing it to tell us what the headers are, requiring a level of human interpretation.




#### Henrik's reflection
At first I thought the assignment was pretty overwhelming and I didn't think I was ever going to be able to finish it. But after some lines of code I began to understand how this program should work, and then it was quite easy and fun from there. I got a little tangled up in the thought of modifying the existing csv-file rather than reading the old one and making a new one, which was a way easier approach. We had a quick chat after Friday's class and Pedro showed how we write csv-files. Had a lot of fun thinking about solutions for this program and then testing them. Especially for plotting the data. Overall my thoughts are that this was a good task and that it's a nice way to learn how to apply the concepts from class. I find working with tasks like this is motivating.
