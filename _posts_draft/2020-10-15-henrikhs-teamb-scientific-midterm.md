# Descrition of reflection
As a team, reflect on the learning experience in Python so far. In particular focus on this assignment and how it improved over the different submission stages, check differences across team members on approaches to the programming task and coding style. Write a blog post (category scientific computing (Links to an external site.)) about these reflections before the beginning of Session 7.

### Henrik's reflection
At first I thought the assignment was pretty overwhelming and I didn't think I was ever going to be able to finish it. But after some lines of code I began to understand how this program should work, and then it was quite easy and fun from there. I got a little tangled up in the thought of modifying the existing csv-file rather than reading the old one and making a new one, which was a way easier approach. We had a quick chat after Friday's class and Pedro showed how we write csv-files. Had a lot of fun thinking about solutions for this program and then testing them. Especially for plotting the data. Overall my thoughts are that this was a good task and that it's a nice way to learn how to apply the concepts from class. I find working with tasks like this is motivating.
