# Introduction
My thesis examines how music software is designed specifically focusing on interfaces and affordances. It proposes three different theoretical perspectives on music software design drawn from various sources which can be used as analytical tools to better understand music software. Central to all these perspectives is the role of metaphors and how metaphors are used in shaping software. This study demonstrates how these theoretical perspectives are interconnected and influence each other. It also looks forward to how AI has the potential to influence these different perspectives in various ways by creating the possibility of new metaphors.

# Design of Music Software
Software plays a vital role in contemporary society. Software is often described as an interface to the world. So, if software acts as an interface to the world, what implications does this have for music? 

What makes music production software an interesting object of study is the inherent tension which arises from the need for this software not only to be functional, meaning it is designed with certain functions meant to serve concrete goals. An example would be recording, every DAW is expected to be able to record and manipulate recorded audio to a certain degree depending on the needs of the user. The tension arises due to the expectation of DAWs being software also created to facilitate creativity. The same tension is also present in plug-ins which seek to fulfil a certain function which cannot be accomplished or cannot be accomplished to the same degree by the DAW while also being tools for the creative exploration of sound. How can music production promote creativity with its design without sacrificing core functionalities? 
## Interfaces
Our engagement with contemporary software is almost always mediated through interfaces. Brenda Laurelâ€™s analysis of interfaces as theatre is striking as it meticulously describes the drama of using software even as mundane as a spreadsheet (2014, 105). 
## Affordances

The physical and virtual are becoming increasingly indistinguishable, and in some cases, the virtual has no physical counterparts.
All tools of music making, even software, have their own framework of affordances they operate within. As James Mooney suggests, no matter what tool you are using, some actions will undoubtedly be easier to do than others (Mooney 2011). Mooney proposes two main categories of frameworks within music-making: Physical and Conceptual frameworks. Physical frameworks are tools such as instruments, software, and synthesizers. But it also includes tools such as pens used to write down notation or the computer mouse used to interact with software (Mooney 2011, 143).
