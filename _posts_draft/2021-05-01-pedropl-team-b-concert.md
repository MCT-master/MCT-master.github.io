## Pedro's Instrumentation

Pedro used a PRS electric guitar connected directly to the MIDAS mixer through a set of pedals for giving a reverb effect and made the connection possible with enough gain. Additional to that, he connected a computer to the stereo input (reached through a local mixer) that was running a stringsâ€™ synthesizer played through a mini-MIDI keyboard.

# Final Team Reflection

For the very beginning of the master programme, Team B has shown a good flow in the activities that has been performed. This time we were challenged in operating the portal and playing together in a better setup than our first online semester. Although this setup had some issues to be solved, we managed to overcome those problems, play, and learn in every opportunity we had in classes, and hours outside them.

For this concert, we decided to go for an improvisation and effect processing, we realized it was the best way to play together according to our musical skills, and it also helps us to dedicate some time to technical issues while keeping a good enough performance that deals with latency.

We hope that in the incoming opportunities we can keep our flow and look for ways to enrich our performance through the technologies explored in the portal.
