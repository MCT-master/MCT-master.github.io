# Introduction
For the grand finale of MCT4022 we, Team B, wanted to play something that should be slightly challenging and rewarding. Through the semester we have been doing improvisations in class, and when working in the Portal outside class, we’ve played things from real punk to Daft Punk. At one point in this semester’s class Henrik and Lindsay did an audio processing improvisation which has been something we wanted to experiment with as a team. Anders being a pedal virtuous was obviously given the main role of doing the processing. A role he was more happy with compared to being the lead singer of our Team B punk band. Willie, who presumably should have been born in the 16th century, suggested that we do a processing improvisation on Bach’s cello prelude in Dm. And so we did.

#### Henrik's Instrumentation

For the performance I played the Teenage Engineering OP-1. We rehearsed with having both Anders and myself processing Willie's guitar, but we quickly figured it got way too messy way too fast. So the solution was assigning the processing role to Anders and me using the OP-1 to play rhythmic patterns for the first part of the performance and switching to a piano for the second part. I then also used the onboard delay effect to create some ambient texture to the sound, blending it with the heavily processed signal from Anders. Speaking of Anders - he also processed my sound locally. Having one of the driest signals, my role was also to be a kind of clock in the performance. Especially for Willie who’s listening situation was slightly different from ours.

#### Pedro's Instrumentation

Pedro used a PRS electric guitar connected directly to the MIDAS mixer through a set of pedals for giving a reverb effect and made the connection possible with enough gain. Additional to that, he connected a computer to the stereo input (reached through a local mixer) that was running a strings’ synthesizer played through a mini-MIDI keyboard.

# Final Team Reflection

For the very beginning of the master programme, Team B has shown a good flow in the activities that has been performed. This time we were challenged in operating the portal and playing together in a better setup than our first online semester. Although this setup had some issues to be solved, we managed to overcome those problems, play, and learn in every opportunity we had in classes, and hours outside them.
Strange issues occurred now and then, where sound was received from NTNU, but not sent. After a good amount of head scratching and debugging, the simplest solution of all seemed to solve it - a good old restart of the LoLa computer. Earlier in the semester, a restart of the converter has given the same result.

For this concert, we decided to go for an improvisation and effect processing, we realized it was the best way to play together according to our musical skills, and it also helps us to dedicate some time to technical issues while keeping a good enough performance that deals with latency.

We hope that in the incoming opportunities we can keep our flow and look for ways to enrich our performance through the technologies explored in the portal.
